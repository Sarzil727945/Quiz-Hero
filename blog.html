          <strong>Map: </strong> 
          The map() method creates a new array with the result of calling a given function on each element of the calling array. <br>
          <strong>Filter: </strong>
          Fielding an array will output the conditions that satisfy it in array form. <br>
          <strong>Find: </strong>
          If you fine an array, the conditions for those will be correct.  Only the first of them will be output in array form. <br>
          <strong>forEach</strong>
          Foreach an array will get all its elements.  But the forEach function cannot return itself.  After returning the output is not available in array form.

             <b>Local storage</b> is the most recent mechanism. It allows for larger amounts of data to be stored, but the data is not deleted when the browser is closed. Local storage is useful for storing data that the user will need to access later, such as offline data. <br>

            <b>Session storage</b> is similar to cookies, but the data is only stored for the current session. This means that the data will be deleted when the user closes the browser. Session storage is useful for storing data that is sensitive, such as login credentials. <br>

            <b>Cookies</b> are the oldest and most well-known mechanism. They are simple to use and well supported by browsers. However, they are limited to 4KB of data and are often used to store data that is not sensitive, such as user preferences. <br>

          The Event Loop has one simple job â€” to monitor the Call Stack and the Callback Queue. If the Call Stack is empty, the Event Loop will take the first event from the queue and will push it to the Call Stack, which effectively runs it. Such an iteration is called a tick in the Event Loop.
